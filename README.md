# IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Challenge

Welcome to the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Challenge! This challenge is designed to explore and analyze factors contributing to employee attrition in a simulated HR setting using a dataset from IBM.

## Overview

Employee attrition can have a significant impact on an organization's productivity and costs. Understanding the underlying factors contributing to attrition is essential for employee retention and overall business success. This challenge aims to provide insights into employee attrition through data analysis and predictive modeling.

## Challenge Objective

The objective of this challenge is to analyze the provided HR dataset and develop predictive models to identify factors that influence employee attrition. Participants are encouraged to explore various machine learning techniques to predict attrition accurately.

## Dataset

The dataset for this challenge is provided by IBM and is available on Kaggle. It includes various features related to employee characteristics, job satisfaction, and work environment. You can access the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mahmoudmagdyelnahal/ibm-hr-analytics-employee-attrition).

## Evaluation

Participants are encouraged to build machine learning models to predict employee attrition. The models' performance will be evaluated based on appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score, depending on the problem formulation.
